Welcome to MeteoNet's Wiki ! Here you will find documentation and help about [MeteoNet](linktowebsite).

## What is MeteoNet ?

MeteoNet is a dataset composed of meteorological data acquired by METEO FRANCE, the French national meteorological service. Our goal is to provide a clean and ready-to-use dataset for Data Scientists who want to try their hand on weather data.

The data spans over 3 years, 2016 to 2018, and covers two geographical areas : the north-western and south-eastern quarters of France.

The dataset regroups **ground station observations**, **land-sea and relief masks**, **rain radar observations**, and **weather forecasting models**. We also plan to give you satellite images very soon !

## Why MeteoNet ?

A complete and clean dataset is a rare and precious thing for a Data Scientist, and we found that no meteorological dataset had these qualities today. That's why we have prepared a clean an open dataset to let the data science community test it, play with it, and innovate.

As we are always willing to improve our knowledge of meteorology and weather forecasting, we hope that by opening this dataset to the research community, people aroud the world will find new ways of forecating the weather with Data Science.
