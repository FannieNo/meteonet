MeteoNet is a dataset composed of meteorological data acquired by Météo France, the French national meteorological service. Our goal is to provide a clean and ready-to-use dataset for Data Scientists who want to try their hand on weather data.

The data spans over 3 years, 2016 to 2018, and covers two geographical areas : the north-western and south-eastern quarters of France.

The dataset regroups ground station observations, land-sea and relief masks, radar observations, and weather models forecasts. We also hope to give you **satellite images** very soon !
