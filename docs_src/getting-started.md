# Getting started with MeteoNet

## MeteoNet toolbox

You are new to MeteoNet ? Start by looking at our sample notebooks on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/meteofrance/meteonet)!

On this repository, you will find a toolbox including **data samples** from MeteoNet, the **meteonet_toolbox python package** with some useful tools and **notebooks** to help you explore and cross-check all data types.

The notebooks should help you open each data type (grid and point data, different resolutions...) and visualize them with maps and relief overlays. 

The notebooks rely on the meteonet_toolbox package and we recommend that you install it. You just have to follow our  [install guide](install.md).



## Download

After checking the notebooks, you should have all you need to start playing around with the real dataset. You can download it [here](link).
