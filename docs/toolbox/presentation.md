# What is it ?


This toolbox includes **data samples** from MeteoNet, the **meteonet_toolbox package** with some useful tools and **notebooks** to help you explore and cross-check all data types.

The notebooks should help you open each data type (grid and point data, different resolutions...) and visualize it with map and relief overlays.

The notebooks rely on the meteonet_toolbox package and we recommend that you install it.
