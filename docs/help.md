# Want to help us ?

We want to build the best possible dataset! If you feel that the dataset is missing something, please publish an issue on our [GitHub repository](somelink). If you want to improve our notebooks or our documentation, please feel free to make a pull request.

## Editing the documentation

This documentation is built with **mkdocs** and configured in our [git repository](http://gitlab.meteo.fr/deep_learning/data_exploration). 

For more information about **mkdocs**, visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

If you want to edit the documentation, you can directly modify the markdown files in the ```docs``` folder.

### Previewing the docs

If you want to get a preview of your changes, start by **installing the following Python packages** :
