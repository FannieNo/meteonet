Welcome to [MeteoNet](linktowebsite)'s documentation! 
## What is MeteoNet ?

MeteoNet is an open meteorological dataset created by METEO FRANCE, the French national meteorological service. Our goal is to provide a clean and ready-to-use dataset for Data Scientists who want to try their hand on weather data.

The data spans over 3 years, 2016 to 2018, and covers two geographical areas : the north-western and south-eastern quarters of France.

The dataset regroups **ground station observations**, **land-sea and relief masks**, **rain radar observations**, and **weather forecasting models**. We also plan to give you satellite images very soon!

## Why MeteoNet?

A complete and clean dataset is a rare and precious thing for a data scientist, and this is what we wanted to provide to the community.

As we are always willing to improve our knowledge of meteorology and weather forecasting, we hope that by opening this dataset to the research community, people aroud the world will find new ways of bringing value to meteorology with data science.
