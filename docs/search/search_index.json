Dew Point The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. When further cooled, the airborne water vapour will condense to form liquid water (dew). When air cools to its dew point through contact with a surface that is colder than the air, water will condense on the surface. 2. Geopotential height Geopotential height or geopotential altitude is a vertical coordinate referenced to Earth's mean sea level, an adjustment to geometric height (altitude above mean sea level) that accounts for the variation of gravity with latitude and altitude. Thus, it can be considered a \"gravity-adjusted height\". The geopotential height is interesting in meteorology because it allows to measure constant pressure levels. It roughly represents the height above sea level of a pressure level. For example, if a station reports that the 500 mb [i.e. millibar] height at its location is 5600 m, it means that the level of the atmosphere over that station at which the atmospheric pressure is 500 mb is 5600 meters above sea level. This is an estimated height based on temperature and pressure data. A high geopotential height is often associated to an anticyclone and a low geopotential height corresponds to a depression. 3. Pseudo-adiabatic Potential Temperature The temperature a sample of air would have if it were expanded by a pseudoadiabatic process to zero pressure and then compressed to a reference pressure of 1000 hPa by a dry-adiabatic process. This parameters allows to compare the temperature of samples of air that are at different altitudes. 4. Vertical Velocity The vertical velocity is the vertical speed of a mass of air. The displacement is expressed in Pa (in meteorology, the vertical levels are often expressed in isobar levels, see Weather Models for more details). The higher the height, the lower the pressure. If the vertical velocity is positive, there is an upward current (ex : the earth surface is warmed by the sun). The opposite corresponds to a downdraft (ex : an cold air mass passes above a warmer ground). 5. Wind Components The U and V wind components are the two wind speed vector components : U : from west to east V : from south to north","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary","text":"This glossary is here to help you understand some specific meteorological terms.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#1-dew-point","text":"The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor.

Radar Data For each radar data type, you will find one archive per year and per zone, each one sliced in periods of 10 or 11 days (each month is separated in 3 files). Each .npz file contains 3 arrays : data : an array containing maps of radar data values. dates : an array containing a datetime object and indicating the date of each data map. miss_dates : an array containing a datetime object for each missing radar map over the period. The time step between two radar scans is 5 min. The radar starts scanning at 00h every day and ends at 23h55. So each file of 11 days should contain a maximum of 3168 rainfall maps (minus the missing dates). The radar's spatial resolution is 0.01\u00b0 and the projection system used is EPSG:4326. You will also find a radar_coords_ZONE.npz file containing 2 arrays lats and lons , indicating the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each radar pixel. 2. Cumulated Rainfall The rainfall data is organized as specified here . The data array contains a rainfall map for each time step. For each pixel, the value represents the cumulated rainfall in hundreth of millimeters ( 10^{-2} mm ). If the value is missing then the value is -1. 3. Rain Radar Quality Code For each pixel of the rainfall product is associated a quality code with values ranging between 0 (very bad) and 100 (perfect), the values are in percents. If the value is missing, then the value is 255. The rain radar quality code data is organized as specified here . The original data was to heavy to be manipulated so the quality code data are divided into 2 files : rainfall_mean_quality_DATE.npz contains the quality code's average over a day and for each pixel. rainfall_diff_quality_DATE.npz contains the difference between the original value and the average over the day for each pixel. Info Remark about the average quality code computation : if there is no value for a whole day on 1 pixel, it will be indicated as a missing value in the mean file, else the mean computation is done over the non missing values for 1 day and 1 pixel. 4. Reflectivity The reflectivity is a measure of the efficiency of a radar target in intercepting and returning radio energy. Each radar emits a signal which is partly reflected by the precipitation and returned to the radar's receiver. The returned signal's power is then compared to a reference power density at a distance of 1 meter from the radar's antenna before computing the reflectivity. The reflectivity factor Z is measured in decibels (dBZ), which can be approximated to a rainfall rate R , expressed in millimeter per hour (mm/h), using the Marshall-Palmer relation: Z = 200.R^{1.6} \\iff R = (\\frac{Z}{200})^\\frac{1}{1.6} Info The 200 and 1.6 coefficients depend on the type of rain and are specific to mainland France. In 2018, METEO FRANCE introduced a new reflectivity product, with additional data (rainfall probability, height measures,...), which definitively replaced the old product in November 2018. Consequently, during the first part of 2018, the two products overlap and both data are available in the dataset. 4.1 Old Product Warning The old product data range from 01/01/2016 to 30/10/18 included. The rain radar data are organized as specified here .

METEO FRANCE's Forecast Models M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France produces several models to forecast the weather. These models are based on physical equations modelling the physical behaviours influencing the weather, such as atmospheric or oceanic phenomenons... They compute a lot of weather parameters (temperature, wind speed, humidity...) at different points on the globe in 4 dimensions (latitude, longitude, height and time). Each model runs several times a day at a fixed time. Each execution is called a ' run '. Each time-step for which we have weather forecasts is called a ' valid time '. On the globe's surface, the points are spaced with regular latitude and longitude steps : this mesh of points is called a grid. On the vertical axis (height), the points are not necessarily regurlarly spaced; the vertical levels can be expressed in height levels in meters or in isobar levels in hPa. The isobar are levels for which the pressure is constant. The 2 main models of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France are AROME and ARPEGE . They do no have the same purposes but they are complementary. ARPEGE is used to forecast the weather at a high scale in space and time. AROME is used to forecast the weather at a finer scale in space and time. Model Name Horizontal Spatial Resolution Number of runs per day Time scale ARPEGE 0.1\u00b0 (~10km) 4 forecasts up to 102 hours ahead AROME 0.025\u00b0 (~1km) 8 forecasts up to 48 hours ahead All these characteristics are the result of compromises between the need for precision and for long time scale and the computing times and costs. In pratice, ARPEGE is used to forecast the weather on Europe and AROME is used to forecast the weather on France. In the dataset, we provided the results of 2D models (forecasts are on a grid longitude x latitude) and 3D models (forecasts are on a grid longitude x latitude x height). 2. 2D Parameters Two 2D weather models are available in the dataset : the fine-mesh French weather model named ' AROME '. the large-mesh French weather model named ' ARPEGE '. For each geographical zone, the two models were run each day at 00h and their forecasts range from 00h to 24h, with a time step of 1h. For each model, the data is stored in 4 different GRIB files, depending on the vertical level of the parameters : File Name Vertical Level Forecasted Parameters 2m 2 meters Temperature (K), Dew point (K), Telative humidity (%) 10m 10 meters Wind speed (m.s -1 ), Wind direction (\u00b0), U and V wind components (m.s -1 ) P_sea_level sea level Mean sea level pressure (Pa) PRECIP ground level Total precipitation (kg.m -2 ) Warning The total precipitation parameter forecast begins at 1h, and not 0h as the other parameters. Info When you open a GRIB file with the xarray library, a new associated .idx file is created. 3. 3D Parameters One 3D weather model is avaible : the large-mesh French weather model named ' ARPEGE '. For each geographical zone (NW and SE), the model was run each day at 00h and its forecasts range from 00h to 24h. The time-step between forecasts vary depending on the time of the day : from 0h to 12h, forecasts are available each hour, and from 12h to 24h, forecasts are available every three hours. Indeed, the model is more precise for the first hours of the days, closer to the moment the model was run, and its precision degrades as time passes.
